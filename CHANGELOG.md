## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- **GVM Vulnerability Scanning** — full end-to-end integration of Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM/OpenVAS) into the RedAmon pipeline:
  - Python scanner module (`gvm_scan/`) with `GVMScanner` class wrapping the GMP protocol for headless API-based scanning
  - Orchestrator endpoints (`/gvm/{id}/start`, `/gvm/{id}/status`, `/gvm/{id}/stop`, `/gvm/{id}/logs`) with SSE log streaming
  - Webapp API routes, `useGvmStatus` polling hook, `useGvmSSE` streaming hook, toolbar buttons, and log drawer on the Graph page
  - Neo4j graph integration — GVM findings stored as `Vulnerability` nodes (source="gvm") linked to IP/Subdomain via `HAS_VULNERABILITY`, with associated `CVE` nodes
  - JSON result download from the Graph page toolbar
- **GVM Per-Project Settings** — GVM scan configuration is now configurable per-project via the webapp UI:
  - New "GVM Scan" tab in Project Settings (between Integrations and Agent Behaviour)
  - 5 configurable fields: Scan Profile, Scan Targets Strategy, Task Timeout, Poll Interval, Cleanup After Scan
  - `gvm_scan/project_settings.py` mirrors the recon/agentic settings pattern (fetch from webapp API, fallback to defaults)
  - Defaults served via orchestrator `/defaults` endpoint using `importlib` to avoid module name collision
  - 5 new Prisma schema fields (`gvm_scan_config`, `gvm_scan_targets`, `gvm_task_timeout`, `gvm_poll_interval`, `gvm_cleanup_after_scan`)

### Changed

- **Webapp Dockerfile** — embedded Prisma CLI in the production image; entrypoint now runs `prisma db push` automatically on startup, eliminating the separate `webapp-init` container
- **Dev Compose** — `docker-compose.dev.yml` now runs `prisma db push` before `npm run dev` to ensure schema is always in sync
- **Docker Compose** — removed `webapp-init` service and `webapp_prisma_cache` volume; webapp handles its own schema migration

### Removed

- **`webapp-init` service** — replaced by automatic migration in the webapp entrypoint (both production and dev modes)
- **`gvm_scan/params.py`** — hardcoded GVM settings replaced by per-project `project_settings.py`

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Attack Path System** — agent now supports dynamic attack path selection with two built-in paths:
  - **CVE Exploit** — automated Metasploit module search, payload configuration, and exploit execution
  - **Brute Force Credential Guess** — service-level brute force with configurable wordlists and max attempts per service
- **Agent Guidance** — send real-time steering messages to the agent while it works, injected into the system prompt before the next reasoning step
- **Agent Stop & Resume** — stop the agent at any point and resume from the last LangGraph checkpoint with full context preserved
- **Project Creation UI** — full frontend project form with all configurable settings sections:
  - Naabu (port scanner), Httpx (HTTP prober), Katana (web crawler), GAU (passive URLs), Kiterunner (API discovery), Nuclei (vulnerability scanner), and agent behavior settings
- **Agent Settings in Frontend** — transferred agent configuration parameters from hardcoded `params.py` to PostgreSQL, editable via webapp UI
- **Metasploit Progress Streaming** — HTTP progress endpoint (port 8013) for real-time MSF command tracking with ANSI escape code cleaning
- **Metasploit Session Auto-Reset** — `msf_restart()` MCP tool for clean msfconsole state; auto-reset on first use per chat session
- **WebSocket Integration** — real-time bidirectional communication between frontend and agent orchestrator
- **Markdown Chat UI** — react-markdown with syntax highlighting for agent chat messages
- **Smart Auto-Scroll** — chat only auto-scrolls when user is at the bottom of the conversation
- **Connection Status Indicator** — color-coded WebSocket connection status (green/red) in the chat interface

### Changed

- **Unified Docker Compose** — replaced per-module `.env` files and `start.sh`/`stop.sh` scripts with a single root `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.dev.yml` for full-stack orchestration
- **Settings Source of Truth** — migrated all recon and agent settings from hardcoded `params.py` to PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM, fetched at runtime via webapp API
- **Recon Pipeline Improvements** — multi-level improvements across all recon modules for reliability and accuracy
- **Orchestrator Model Selection** — fixed model selection logic in the agent orchestrator
- **Frontend Usability** — unified RedAmon primary crimson color (#d32f2f), styled message containers with ghost icons and gradient backgrounds, improved markdown heading and list spacing
- **Environment Configuration** — added root `.env.example` with all required keys; forwarded NVD_API_KEY and Neo4j credentials from recon-orchestrator to spawned containers
- **Webapp Header** — replaced Crosshair icon with custom logo.png image, bumped logo text size

### Fixed

- **Double Approval Dialog** — fixed duplicate approval confirmation with ref-based state tracking
- **Orchestrator Model Selection** — corrected model selection logic when switching between AI providers
